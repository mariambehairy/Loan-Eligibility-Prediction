# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
Introduction

This Python program utilizes two datasets, "loan_old.csv" and "loan_new.csv," to build and evaluate models for predicting loan decisions and amounts based on applicant details. The features include gender, education, income, credit history, etc. Two models are implemented: linear regression for predicting loan amounts and logistic regression for loan status.
